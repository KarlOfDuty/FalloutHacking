# FalloutHacking
My first university project, a simple SFML implementation of the hacking minigame from the Fallout series.

I am uploading this almost 10 years after I made it, so I had to do some refactoring before I got it to build again.

# Usage

1. Download the [release](https://github.com/KarlOfDuty/FalloutHacking/releases) for your operating system.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Run the executable.

# Building
Install the following packages: `sfml`, `cmake`, `gcc`.

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the project directory in a terminal.
3. Create and enter a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`.
4. Generate cmake project: `cmake ..`
5. Build project: `make`
6. Run game: `./FalloutHacking`
