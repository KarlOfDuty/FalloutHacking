# FalloutHacking
My first university project, a simple SFML implementation of the hacking minigame from the Fallout series.

I am uploading this almost 10 years after I made it, so I had to do some refactoring before I got it to build again.

The license only applies to the code in this repo, I don't remember the source for the other assets so don't assume that they can be used freely.
